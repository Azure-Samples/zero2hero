## Learning objectives

👉🏼 Create a new .NET App from scratch.  
👉🏼 Code and test.  
👉🏼 Add documentation.  
👉🏼 Deploy to Azure Container Apps.  

## Success criteria

🎯 Show your **HERO** App running on Azure Container Apps.

## 1. Setup your environment

Follow this [guide](../setup/) to configure your environment and login to GitHub and Azure.

## 2. Create the App

We want to ask GitHub Copilot Chat about the steps we need to do to create a Blazor serverside .NET application. The name of the app should be HeroBlazorApp. Ensure that the prerequirements are included.

> 
> `steps to create a .NET blazor server app called HeroBlazorApp in the terminal and include pre-requirements`
</details>
<br/>  

🟦 Run the `dotnet new` command generated by GitHub Copilot.  
🟦 Install any suggested VS Code extension.  

## 3. Add the User entity

🟦 Create and open a new file named `User.cs` under the folder `Data`.  

Now we want to create a User entity, preferably as a User class in the HeroBlazorApp.Data namespace. A User has the following properties: id, name, username, email, phone number and website. We also want to do a JSON mapping. You can use GitHub Copilot Chat or inline completion.

</details>
<br/>  

## 4. Change the razor page to add the new Service

🟦 Open the `Program.cs` file.  
🟦 Place the cursor before the `builder.Build` instruction.  

Next we want to add a builder for a User service singleton and a http client. Feel free to use GitHub Copilot in whatever way you are most comfortable with to keep you in your coding flow.

> 
> `add builder for user service singleton and http client`
</details>
<br/>  

🟦 Add the `AddSingleton` and `AddHttpClient` generated code.  
🟦 Open the `Pages/FetchData.razor` file and select all the content.  

And then we want to edit our Razor page to display the user informations that we have fetched from our user service.

> 
> `change this razor page with the router /fetchdata that display user information from the user service`
</details>
<br/>  

🟦 Accept the generated content.  

## 5. Test it locally

Finally we want to test our code. Ask GitHub Copilot Chat how to run the application locally.

> 
> `run my app`
</details>
<br/>  

🟦 Save all the files.  
🟦 Run `dotnet run` on the terminal.  
🟦 Open the browser and test the App.  

## 6. Add documentation

No one likes writing documentation, but everyone needs documentation. Luckily GitHub Copilot can also help you with that. Ask GitHub Copilot Chat to support you writing a `README.md` for our project.

> 
> `create a readme file in markdown format for this project`
</details>
<br/>  

🟦 Click on the `...` and choose `insert into New file`.  
🟦 Save the file as `READNE.md`.  

## 7. Deploy to Azure

Everything is up, running and documented? Great, now let's deploy it to Azure Container Apps. For this simple task we can use the Azure CLI. Use GitHub Copilot Chat to ensure all needed parameters are set and we have access to our App by creating an external ingress in the Azure region of your choice.

> `use the az containerapp up command to deploy my app named heroblazorapp with external ingress on an environment named heroenv, a resource group named zero2hero-blazor located in west europe with the source parameter as "."`
</details>
<br/>  

🟦 Click on the `...` and choose `insert into Terminal`.  
🟦 Run the `az` command and wait until it finishes.  
🟦 Open the provided URL and test your App.  
🟦 Open the Azure Portal and check the resources that were created with the `az containerapp up` command.  
🟦 Open the Log Analytics workspace and browse to the `ContainerAppConsoleLogs_CL` table to see the App logs.  

## Conclusion

### ✨ Let's review GitHub Copilot

- Identified requirements and generated the command to create the App?  
- Generated entire new C# classes to extend the App and assisted to improve the code?  
- Generated documentation in markdown format based on the project context?  
- Generated the all-in-one command to deploy the App in Azure Container Apps?  

### 🗑️ Clean up Azure resources

When you're finished with the lab, you should remove all your deployed resources from Azure to avoid extra charges and keep your Azure subscription uncluttered.

#### 📈 You had any problems with this journey, an idea how to improve it or an idea for a new journey? We are looking forward for your feedback as an issue or pull request. ✨

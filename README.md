# Zero 2 Hero with GitHub Copilot

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/Azure-Samples/zero2hero/tree/main)

This repo contains a set of sample journeys and challenges to demonstrate and explore what we can do with GitHub Copilot, the Chat functionality and the power of the triad: #GitHub + #VisualStudio + #Azure 🚀

👉🏼 The goal here is to enable everyone to start from a blank environment and jump start on building Apps and deploying it to the Cloud (we use Azure here but the concepts are universal).

✨ We will leverage GitHub Copilot for much more than just programming code. GitHub Copilot will be our AI assistant to help us with the installation of the development frameworks, create the App code, build container images, create Azure resources, deploy code, create CI/CD workflows, build infrastructure as code, and much more.

🤯 Limitless possibilities at your fingertips, and you can even use your [voice](https://githubnext.com/projects/copilot-voice/)!

## Journeys

Starting from scratch, without making any assumptions, packs quite a punch of advantages. Whether you're a seasoned programmer or just hitting the launchpad, I'm confident you'll reap plenty of benefits from the journeys ahead.

## Learning objectives

Here's a simple challenge to kickstart your journey with Azure OpenAI and GitHub Copilot. The following steps are merely a guide. Unleash your creativity to stand out and construct something genuinely innovative. Now, let's get cracking, my future Willy Wonka of coding!

## Success criteria

🎯 Show off your very own, one-of-a-kind, `Sarcastic Bot`, operating with all the gusto of a caffeinated squirrel, either nestled cozily in your local machine or gallivanting around in Azure.

## 1. Setup your environment

Follow this [guide](../../journeys/setup/) to setup your environment.

## 2. Create the App
